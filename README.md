# Anomaly-Detection-using-Prophet

  Anomaly detection identifies data points or observations that deviate from a datasetâ€™s normal behavior. Anomalous data can indicate critical incidents or even potential opportunities.
  
  Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well.
  
  
  In this project i used prophet model to detect anomaly in New York taxi dataset.
